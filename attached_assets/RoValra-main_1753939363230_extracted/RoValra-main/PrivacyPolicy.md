**Privacy Policy for RoValra Chrome Extension**

**Effective Date:** 4/20/25

**Introduction**

This Privacy Policy describes how the RoValra Chrome extension ("the Extension") handles user data. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about our data practices.

**Information We Do Not Collect**

RoValra does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) from users. This includes, but is not limited to, names, email addresses, browsing history, or any other data that could be used to identify you. The Extension primarily interacts with Roblox's services and APIs, a developer-controlled API, and potentially other third-party APIs as detailed in the **Third-Party Services** section.

**Use of IP Address and Geolocation (Client-Side)**

The Extension utilizes your IP address and geolocation information **only on your local device** to interact with the Roblox platform. This enhances the functionality of the extension by allowing it to find the appropriate Roblox servers based on your location.

**Important points about IP/geolocation usage:**

*   **No server storage:** Your IP address and geolocation data are processed entirely within your browser and **are not sent to or stored on any external servers controlled by us or third parties.**
*   **Client-side only:** All processing of IP/geolocation data is done within your browser window and does not leave your local system.
*   **Limited Functionality:** The information is used exclusively to interact with Roblox’s API and provide the intended functionality of the extension.

**Data Security**

As the extension does not store or transmit your personal data to external servers controlled by us, traditional security measures like server-side encryption for user data are not applicable to our infrastructure. All processing involving potentially sensitive information like IP/geolocation occurs on your local machine.

**Third-Party Services**

To provide its features, RoValra interacts with several Application Programming Interfaces (APIs):

1.  **Roblox's APIs:** Essential for interacting with the Roblox platform itself.
2.  **Developer-Controlled API (Valra):** An API managed by the RoValra developer, used solely to retrieve specific data necessary for certain extension features.
3.  **Other Third-Party APIs:** The Extension may interact with other external APIs not controlled by Roblox or the developer (Valra). These are used strictly to *retrieve* information required for specific features (e.g., fetching public data relevant to the extension's purpose).

**Crucially, the interaction with all APIs listed above is limited to *retrieving* information.** **No personally identifiable information (PII), IP address, geolocation, or any other user-specific data is sent from the Extension to any of these APIs (Roblox, Valra, or other third parties).** Data flow is one-way: the Extension requests public or necessary functional data *from* these services; it does not send your data *to* them.

**Data Retention**

Since the extension does not collect or store any personal information on external servers, there is no data retention period applicable to user PII.

**Children's Privacy**

The Extension is designed not to collect any personal data. As such, it is compliant with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) requirements regarding the collection of personal information from children.

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we will update the “Effective Date.” Your continued use of the Extension after any changes signifies your acceptance of the new policy.
