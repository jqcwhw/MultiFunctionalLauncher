# Roblox Multi-Account Manager

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed to manage multiple Roblox accounts and instances. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and controlling Roblox game instances, with features for account management, instance lifecycle control, activity logging, and system monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between client and server code:
- **Client**: React SPA with component-based architecture
- **Server**: RESTful API with Express middleware
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types shared between client and server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modular components using shadcn/ui design system
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for request logging and error handling
- **Storage**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation
- **Development**: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development

### Database Schema
The application uses four main entities:
- **Accounts**: User account information with optional Roblosecurity tokens
- **Instances**: Game instance configurations linked to accounts
- **Activity Logs**: System and instance-level logging
- **Settings**: Application configuration key-value pairs

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle business logic and data validation
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response Handling**: Structured JSON responses with error handling
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages caching and synchronization

- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database toolkit
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing

### UI Dependencies

- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **class-variance-authority**: Conditional styling utility

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Neon Database with connection pooling
- **Build Process**: Vite builds client, esbuild bundles server
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration

### Production Deployment
- **Client Build**: Static assets generated by Vite
- **Server Build**: Bundled Node.js application with esbuild
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations
- **Process Management**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment flag for development/production
- **PORT**: Server port configuration

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
