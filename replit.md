# Roblox Multi-Account Manager

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application designed to manage multiple Roblox accounts and instances. The application provides a comprehensive dashboard for monitoring and controlling Roblox game instances, with features for account management, instance lifecycle control, activity logging, and system monitoring.

## System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI components with Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)

### Architecture Pattern
The application follows a monorepo structure with a clear separation between client and server code:
- **Client**: React SPA with component-based architecture
- **Server**: RESTful API with Express middleware
- **Shared**: Common schemas and types shared between client and server
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Modular components using shadcn/ui design system
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming
- **Icons**: Lucide React for consistent iconography

### Backend Architecture
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints for CRUD operations
- **Middleware**: Express middleware for request logging and error handling
- **Storage**: Abstracted storage interface with in-memory implementation
- **Development**: Vite integration for hot module replacement in development

### Database Schema
The application uses four main entities:
- **Accounts**: User account information with optional Roblosecurity tokens
- **Instances**: Game instance configurations linked to accounts
- **Activity Logs**: System and instance-level logging
- **Settings**: Application configuration key-value pairs

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using TanStack Query
2. **Server Processing**: Express routes handle business logic and data validation
3. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM manages PostgreSQL interactions
4. **Response Handling**: Structured JSON responses with error handling
5. **State Management**: TanStack Query manages caching and synchronization

## External Dependencies

### Core Framework Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database toolkit
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **react-hook-form**: Form state management
- **wouter**: Lightweight routing

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Accessible component primitives
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **class-variance-authority**: Conditional styling utility

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and development server
- **typescript**: Type checking
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for Node.js

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Local Development**: Vite dev server with HMR
- **Database**: Neon Database with connection pooling
- **Build Process**: Vite builds client, esbuild bundles server
- **Environment**: NODE_ENV-based configuration

### Production Deployment
- **Client Build**: Static assets generated by Vite
- **Server Build**: Bundled Node.js application with esbuild
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle migrations
- **Process Management**: Single Node.js process serving both API and static files

### Environment Configuration
- **DATABASE_URL**: PostgreSQL connection string
- **NODE_ENV**: Environment flag for development/production
- **PORT**: Server port configuration

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Changelog

### July 08, 2025 - Comprehensive Research Completed
- **Extracted and analyzed all 19 zip files** containing Roblox tools and libraries
- **Discovered critical UWP_MultiPlatform solution** - the exact technique for creating multiple Roblox instances
- **Identified core implementation approach**: UWP package cloning with manifest modification
- **Cataloged supporting tools**: Account management, automation scripts, API wrappers, and UI libraries
- **Created comprehensive analysis document** with implementation roadmap
- **Found proven multi-instance technique** that works with current Roblox UWP applications

### Key Discovery: UWP Multi-Instance Implementation
The UWP_MultiPlatform project provides the complete solution:
1. Clone ROBLOX UWP package directory structure
2. Modify AppxManifest.xml for unique package identity
3. Remove package signature to allow modifications
4. Register new package using PowerShell Add-AppxPackage
5. Launch instances via shell protocol

### Next Implementation Phase
Ready to implement the core UWP multi-instance engine based on proven C# techniques, translated to Node.js architecture with web dashboard integration.

### July 08, 2025 - Enhanced Multi-Instance System Implementation
- **Integrated official Roblox GitHub repository patterns** from their open-source libraries (Roact, Rodux, Jest-Roblox)
- **Created comprehensive Enhanced Process Manager** with advanced Roblox process management
- **Enhanced UWP Instance Manager** with mutex management and registry modification integration  
- **Added Enhanced System dashboard page** with real-time monitoring and protection status
- **Implemented official Roblox coding patterns** for better compatibility and reliability
- **Created advanced API routes** for mutex management, registry control, and enhanced process monitoring
- **Platform-aware initialization** that skips Windows-specific features on non-Windows systems
- **Real-time process monitoring** with CPU, memory, and GPU usage tracking
- **Anti-detection measures** using official Roblox singleton mutex bypass techniques

### Technical Enhancements Applied
- **Roblox Mutex Manager**: PowerShell-based ROBLOX_singletonMutex bypass
- **Registry Manager**: Windows registry modifications for multi-client isolation
- **Enhanced Process Manager**: Advanced process launching with authentication injection
- **Resource Management**: CPU/memory limits and window positioning control
- **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Detects and adapts to non-Windows environments
