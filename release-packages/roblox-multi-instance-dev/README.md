## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=5000
```

### System Requirements

**Minimum:**

## üìã Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Administrator rights required" error:**
- Right-click the application and select "Run as administrator"
- Ensure User Account Control (UAC) is enabled

**"Roblox UWP not found" error:**
- Install Roblox from the Microsoft Store (not the web version)
- Ensure the UWP version is properly installed

**Instance creation fails:**
- Check that Windows Developer Mode is enabled
- Verify sufficient disk space for instance cloning
- Ensure antivirus isn't blocking file operations

**Sync not working:**
- Confirm both instances are running and visible
- Check that AutoHotkey is installed (for advanced features)
- Verify instance windows are not minimized

### Performance Optimization

- **Limit concurrent instances** based on your hardware
- **Use lower sync delays** only on powerful systems
- **Close unnecessary instances** when not in use
- **Monitor resource usage** in the System Resources panel
