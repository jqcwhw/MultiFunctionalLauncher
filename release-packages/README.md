# Roblox Multi-Instance Manager - Release Package

## üéÆ What This Does

This is a **real, working multi-instance system** for Roblox that uses proven techniques from 19+ researched projects including:

- **MultiBloxy** by Zgoly (C# mutex bypass)
- **MultiRoblox** by Dashbloxx (C implementation)  
- **UWP Multi-Platform** (Package cloning technique)
- **Working AutoHotkey scripts** for multi-client management

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Windows Users
1. Download the portable package
2. Double-click `START_WINDOWS.bat`
3. Browser opens automatically to http://localhost:3000
4. Start launching multiple Roblox instances!

### Mac/Linux Users  
1. Download the portable package
2. Open terminal in the folder
3. Run: `./START_UNIX.sh`
4. Open browser to http://localhost:3000

## üîß How It Works

### Core Multi-Instance Technique
Uses the **ROBLOX_singletonEvent mutex bypass** technique:

1. **Mutex Creation**: Creates `ROBLOX_singletonEvent` mutex before Roblox does
2. **Registry Modification**: Modifies Windows registry for multi-client support
3. **Process Spawning**: Launches multiple `RobloxPlayerBeta.exe` processes  
4. **UWP Cloning**: Creates cloned UWP packages with unique identities

### Supported Methods
- **Direct Execution**: Spawns RobloxPlayerBeta.exe directly
- **Protocol Handler**: Uses roblox-player: protocol
- **UWP Shell**: Clones and registers UWP packages
- **PowerShell**: Advanced Windows-specific launching

## üéØ Features

- **Real Multi-Instance**: Actually launches multiple Roblox processes
- **Account Management**: Support for .ROBLOSECURITY cookies
- **Game URL Support**: Direct game joining with place IDs
- **Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and process tracking
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, Mac, and Linux (Windows for full functionality)

## üî¨ Technical Details

### Anti-Detection Methods
Based on analysis of 19+ projects:
- Mutex management for singleton bypass
- Process isolation techniques  
- Registry modification (Windows)
- UWP package cloning with unique identities

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Modern web interface with real-time updates
- **Backend**: Node.js server with Express
- **Engine**: Custom multi-instance engine based on research
- **Platform**: Cross-platform with Windows optimizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"No Roblox installation found"**: Install Roblox from official website
2. **"Permission denied"**: Run as administrator on Windows
3. **"Port 3000 already in use"**: Change PORT in server.js
4. **"Mutex creation failed"**: Restart application or system

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` in server.js for detailed logging.
